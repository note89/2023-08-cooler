The **`Loan`** struct includes the original request, the calculated loan amount (principal + interest), collateral amount, expiry time, lender's address, and the repayment preferences. The **`loanID`** is set to the current length of the **`loans`** array, effectively assigning a unique ID to each new loan.","file":"Cooler/src/Cooler.sol","highlight":[{"start":253,"end":265}],"title":"","id":"596"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"These data structures and functions form the core of the loan management system in the `Cooler` contract. The `Request` and `Loan` structs define the parameters for loan requests and active loans, while the arrays and mapping provide storage and access mechanisms. The `requestLoan` and `clearRequest` functions demonstrate how these structures are used to create and manage loans in the system.","title":"","id":"592"}]}
