{"title":"gOHM Lending: Cooler Facility Overview","id":"AYVd7EK2UU+IqJKPFrgrVKXa3t/FcjZ1bL4QcmW6hig=","position":2,"steps":[{"type":"textOnly","description":"The **Cooler Lending Facility** is a decentralized application built on the **Ethereum** blockchain. It enables users to secure fixed-term loans using their `gOHM` (**Governance OHM**) holdings as collateral. The system consists of three main smart contracts: `Cooler`, `CoolerFactory`, and `Clearinghouse`. These contracts work together to facilitate peer-to-peer loans with user-defined debt-collateral pairs.","title":"","id":"531"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["Cooler/src/Cooler.sol"],"description":"The **Cooler** contract serves as the core component of the lending facility. It manages individual loans, handling the entire lifecycle from loan requests to repayments or defaults.\n\n**PURPOSE**: To facilitate and manage fixed-duration, peer-to-peer loans for user-defined debt-collateral pairs.\n\n**WHAT it does**:\n- Handles loan requests\n- Manages loan issuance\n- Processes repayments\n- Handles loan rollovers\n- Manages defaults\n\n**HOW it does it**:\nThe **Cooler** contract uses structs to represent loan requests and active loans. It provides functions for borrowers to request loans and lenders to clear these requests. The contract escrows collateral, calculates interest, and manages the loan lifecycle.\n\n**HOW it is used**:\nBorrowers interact with the **Cooler** to request loans and repay them. Lenders use it to fund loan requests and claim defaulted loans.\n\n**HOW it relates to other components**:\nThe **Cooler** is created by the **CoolerFactory** and interacts with the **Clearinghouse** for loan operations.","title":"","id":"532"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The **CoolerFactory** contract manages the creation and tracking of **Cooler** contracts.\n\n**PURPOSE**: To deploy and keep track of **Cooler** contracts for unique user-debt-collateral combinations.\n\n**WHAT it does**:\n- Creates new **Cooler** contracts\n- Tracks created **Coolers**\n- Emits events for **Cooler** operations\n\n**HOW it does it**:\nThe `generateCooler` function creates new **Cooler** contracts using a cloning mechanism for gas efficiency. It stores references to created **Coolers** in mappings and emits events for significant actions.\n\n**HOW it is used**:\nUsers interact with the **CoolerFactory** to create new **Cooler** contracts for their specific lending needs.\n\n**HOW it relates to other components**:\nThe **CoolerFactory** creates and keeps track of **Cooler** contracts, which are then used by the **Clearinghouse** for loan operations.","file":"Cooler/src/CoolerFactory.sol","highlight":[{"start":58,"end":78}],"title":"","id":"533"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The **Clearinghouse** contract acts as the centralized management layer for the lending facility.\n\n**PURPOSE**: To manage the overall lending process and integrate with external systems like `Olympus V3`.\n\n**WHAT it does**:\n- Facilitates lending operations\n- Manages loan parameters\n- Handles rebalancing between the contract and treasury\n- Implements safety features like emergency shutdown\n\n**HOW it does it**:\nThe **Clearinghouse** uses functions like `lendToCooler` to interact with `Cooler` contracts. It manages loan parameters, handles treasury interactions, and implements access control for critical functions.\n\n**HOW it is used**:\nThe **Clearinghouse** is used to initiate loans, manage outstanding debt, and control the overall lending facility.\n\n**HOW it relates to other components**:\nThe **Clearinghouse** interacts with `Cooler` contracts created by the `CoolerFactory` to manage the lending process. It also integrates with external systems like the `Olympus` treasury.","file":"Cooler/src/Clearinghouse.sol","highlight":[{"start":129,"end":152}],"title":"","id":"534"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"The **Cooler Lending Facility** uses these three main contracts to create a decentralized lending system. The `CoolerFactory` deploys individual `Cooler` contracts, which manage specific loans.
